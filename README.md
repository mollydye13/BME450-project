## Project decription
Have you ever looked at a mole and wondered if you should schedule a doctor’s appointment? We aim to use deep learning to help answer this question! Benign moles are not cancerous and not harmful, while malignant skin moles are cancerous and should be treated quickly to avoid further health complications. Treatment options for those with a malignant mole may involve surgery, radiation therapies, or medications. Decisions for treatment plans should be made with a consideration of medical professional’s recommendations. For this reason, this neural network is going to be designed to only give a benign or malignant result, not to classify the stage or type of cancer as it is intended to encourage the user to seek care from a medical professional.
  
The goal of our project is to create a neural network that is able to take in an image of a mole and classify it as benign or malignant. Furthermore, a successful algorithm such as this could be implemented in a smart-phone app to allow people to determine at home whether they should seek medical care for their skin mole. It could also be useful for training and supporting future dermatologists in their decision-making for patient treatment options. Development of similar or more advanced algorithms could be used all throughout the healthcare system for cancer and other disease diagnosis.
 
The data set that will be used for this project consists of a total of 2,397 images of skin moles; 1,800 benign and 1,497 malignant. This data set can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign/data
